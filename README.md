# PiezoShoe-
Here we built a MEMS level piezoelectric energy harvester for collecting energy from walking at a frequency of 1-10Hz, primarily designed for pedometer applications. This can be embedded in shoes, and a coupe of designs had been approached before the final optimal design maximum power generation and required safety factor was developed.
